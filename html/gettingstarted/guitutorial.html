<h2>Tutorial to the Graphical Surface</h2>

<h3>I. Overview</h3>

The JGlove graphical surface gives the user the chance to configure the surface to fit
individual requirements. All views can be placed by the user 
at any spot outside and within the JGlove main window view. 
<br/><br/>
The Monitor view and the the Sensor Setup view are open at any time and can not be closed.
All other views can be opened and closed by the user.
